This is the application used for the pilot of Remindavax in Karnataka, India. We are working with Karuna Trust, a healthcare NGO with 35 Primary Health Centers in Karnataka, India, to run a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of SMS reminders on the attendance of pregnant women for their prenatal clinics. This trial is supported by the Harvard School of Public Health.
